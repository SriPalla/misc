To connect to a local instance of Key Vault, such as the `lowkey-vault` Docker container, from a Python application, you can use the `azure-keyvault-secrets` library along with a custom `DefaultAzureCredential`. Here, I'll guide you through the process of setting up the `lowkey-vault` Docker container, configuring it, and connecting to it from Python.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Set Up `lowkey-vault` Docker Container

First, you need to run the `lowkey-vault` Docker container. You can pull and run it with the following commands:

```sh
docker pull danielwertheim/lowkey-vault
docker run -d --name lowkey-vault -p 7070:7070 -p 8443:8443 danielwertheim/lowkey-vault
```

#### Step 2: Configure Your Python Environment

You need to install the required Azure libraries if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install azure-keyvault-secrets azure-identity
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Python Code to Connect to `lowkey-vault`

In this step, you'll write Python code to connect to the local `lowkey-vault` instance. Since `lowkey-vault` mimics Azure Key Vault, you can use the same client libraries, but you need to adjust the credential and endpoint configurations.

##### Sample Python Code

Here's an example of how to configure and connect to the `lowkey-vault` instance:

```python
import os
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.keyvault.secrets import SecretClient
from azure.core.pipeline.transport import RequestsTransport

# Replace with your Key Vault URL
key_vault_url = "https://localhost:8443"

# Optionally disable SSL verification (not recommended for production)
transport = RequestsTransport(connection_verify=False)

# Use DefaultAzureCredential for local development
# You might need to set environment variables for AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET if using Azure credentials
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

# Create a SecretClient using the local Key Vault URL and the credential
client = SecretClient(vault_url=key_vault_url, credential=credential, transport=transport)

# Example: Setting and getting a secret
secret_name = "example-secret"
secret_value = "my-secret-value"

# Set a secret
client.set_secret(secret_name, secret_value)

# Get the secret
retrieved_secret = client.get_secret(secret_name)

print(f"Secret value: {retrieved_secret.value}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Docker Command**: This pulls the `lowkey-vault` Docker image and runs it, exposing it on ports 7070 and 8443.

2. **Library Installation**: Installs the necessary Azure libraries to interact with Key Vault.

3. **Custom Transport**: Disables SSL verification in the `RequestsTransport` to allow connecting to the local `lowkey-vault` instance without SSL verification (useful for local development).

4. **DefaultAzureCredential**:
