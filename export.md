To resolve the error "Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos," you need to ensure that your MongoDB instance is running as a replica set. Given that you are on a MacBook M3 and using Docker, here's a refined approach to set up a MongoDB replica set using Docker Compose:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create the Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the MongoDB service. Ensure that the MongoDB service is configured to run as a replica set.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.4.3
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
      - ./initiateReplicaSet.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initiateReplicaSet.sh
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
      - MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=admin

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

#### 2. Create the Initialization Script

Create a script named `initiateReplicaSet.sh` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. This script will initiate the replica set.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Wait for MongoDB to start
echo "Waiting for MongoDB to start..."
until mongo --host localhost --eval "print(\"waited for connection\")"
do
    sleep 5
done

# Initiate the replica set
echo "Initiating replica set..."
mongo --host localhost <<EOF
rs.initiate(
  {
    _id: "rs0",
    version: 1,
    members: [
      { _id: 0, host: "localhost:27017" }
    ]
  }
)
EOF

# Wait until the replica set is initiated and a primary is elected
until mongo --host localhost --eval "rs.status().members[0].stateStr" | grep PRIMARY
do
    sleep 5
done

echo "Replica set initiated and primary elected."
```

Make sure the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x initiateReplicaSet.sh
```

#### 3. Build and Run the Docker Containers

Run the following command in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and `initiateReplicaSet.sh` files:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Explanation

- **Docker Compose File**: Defines a single MongoDB service running on port 27017. The initialization script is copied into the container and executed on startup.
- **Initialization Script**: 
  - Waits for MongoDB to start.
  - Initiates the replica set.
  - Waits until the replica set is fully initiated and a primary is elected.

### Connecting to the Single Instance Replica Set from Spring Boot

Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to use the MongoDB replica set:

**application.properties**:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=false
```

**application.yml**:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=false
```

Replace `yourDatabaseName` with the name of your database.

### Additional Notes

- **Network Configuration**: Ensure that your Docker setup allows for the necessary network communication.
- **Retry Mechanism**: If you still face issues, consider adding a retry mechanism or increasing the sleep duration in the script to ensure that MongoDB has enough time to start up and initiate the replica set properly.

This setup should ensure that the MongoDB instance is fully ready and the replica set is properly initiated before any connections are attempted, allowing Spring Data transactions to work correctly.
