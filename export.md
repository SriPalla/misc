When designing APIs, especially for mission-critical systems, it's crucial to define and adhere to specific non-functional requirements (NFRs). Below are some key NFRs related to response time, retry definitions for downstream calls, availability, memory and CPU consumption for pod-based deployments, and performance testing:

### 1. **Response Time**
   - **Definition**: The maximum time the API takes to respond to a request under specified conditions.
   - **Targets**:
     - **Normal Load**: The API should respond within X milliseconds (e.g., 200ms) for 95% of the requests.
     - **Peak Load**: The API should respond within Y milliseconds (e.g., 500ms) for 95% of the requests during peak load conditions.
   - **Timeouts**: Define the maximum time the API should wait for a response from a downstream service (e.g., 2 seconds). If the downstream service does not respond within this time, the API should handle the timeout gracefully.
   - **Measurement**: Implement logging and monitoring to measure response times continuously.

### 2. **Retry Definitions for Downstream Calls**
   - **Retry Policy**: Define how and when the API should retry a call to a downstream service if it fails.
     - **Max Retries**: Specify the maximum number of retry attempts (e.g., 3 attempts).
     - **Backoff Strategy**: Use an exponential backoff strategy with a cap (e.g., start with 100ms delay and double each time, up to a maximum of 1 second).
     - **Circuit Breaker**: Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent overloading downstream services by temporarily stopping retries if the failure rate exceeds a certain threshold.
   - **Idempotency**: Ensure that retryable operations are idempotent, meaning they can be safely repeated without causing unintended side effects.

### 3. **Availability**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of time the API is operational and accessible over a given period.
   - **Targets**:
     - **High Availability**: Target an availability of at least 99.9% (commonly referred to as "three nines"), equating to approximately 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
     - **Disaster Recovery**: Define an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) to ensure the API can recover from outages with minimal data loss.
   - **Redundancy**: Use multiple instances or regions to ensure high availability. Consider active-active or active-passive failover setups.
   - **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to ensure that only healthy instances are serving traffic.

### 4. **Memory and CPU Consumption for Pod-Based Deployment**
   - **Resource Requests and Limits**:
     - **Memory**: Define memory requests and limits for each pod (e.g., request 512MB, limit 1GB). The request ensures the pod gets enough memory to operate under normal conditions, while the limit prevents it from consuming too much.
     - **CPU**: Define CPU requests and limits similarly (e.g., request 0.5 CPU, limit 1 CPU).
   - **Scaling**: Implement horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU or memory usage to handle varying loads dynamically.
   - **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor memory and CPU consumption to detect and address any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

### 5. **Performance Testing**
   - **Load Testing**: Simulate expected user loads to ensure the API can handle normal and peak traffic without degradation.
     - **Tools**: Use tools like JMeter, Gatling, or Locust to generate load.
     - **Metrics**: Measure response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization under load.
   - **Stress Testing**: Test the API under extreme conditions to identify breaking points and understand how the system fails.
     - **Objectives**: Determine the maximum capacity of the API and ensure it fails gracefully when limits are exceeded.
   - **Capacity Planning**: Use results from performance testing to inform capacity planning and ensure that sufficient resources are provisioned.
   - **Endurance Testing**: Run the API under a continuous load for an extended period to identify memory leaks or performance degradation over time.

These NFRs help ensure that the API is reliable, scalable, and performs well under various conditions. Implementing proper monitoring and alerting systems will also allow you to maintain these standards in production.
