To set up a single instance MongoDB replica set in Docker and avoid the "namespace not found" error, you need to ensure that the replica set is properly initiated and that the `local.oplog.rs` collection is created. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Create the Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the MongoDB service.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.4.3
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
      - ./initiateReplicaSet.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initiateReplicaSet.sh
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

#### 2. Create the Initialization Script

Create a script named `initiateReplicaSet.sh` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. This script will initiate the replica set.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Waiting for MongoDB to start..."
until mongo --eval "print(\"waited for connection\")"
do
    sleep 5
done

echo "Initiating replica set..."
mongo --eval "
  rs.initiate(
    {
      _id: 'rs0',
      version: 1,
      members: [
        { _id: 0, host: 'localhost:27017' }
      ]
    }
  )
"
```

Make sure the script is executable:

```sh
chmod +x initiateReplicaSet.sh
```

#### 3. Build and Run the Docker Containers

Run the following command in the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` and `initiateReplicaSet.sh` files:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Explanation

- **Docker Compose File**: Defines a single MongoDB service running on port 27017. The initialization script is copied into the container and executed on startup.
- **Initialization Script**: The script waits for MongoDB to start and then initiates the replica set.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter the "namespace not found" error, it may be because the replica set was not properly initiated or the oplog was not created. The initialization script provided should handle this by ensuring that the replica set is properly initiated.

### Connecting to the Single Instance Replica Set from Spring Boot

Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to use the MongoDB replica set:

**application.properties**:

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=false
```

**application.yml**:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/yourDatabaseName?replicaSet=rs0&retryWrites=false
```

Replace `yourDatabaseName` with the name of your database.

This setup should provide a single instance MongoDB replica set running in Docker, properly initiated to avoid the "namespace not found" error, and configured to connect to your Spring Boot application.
