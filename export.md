To delete a Spring Batch entry for the current date to re-run the job, you typically need to delete records in the Spring Batch metadata tables that track the job’s execution. Specifically, you would delete entries in the `BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION` and `BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE` tables. Here’s a safe approach to do that:

1. **Identify the Job Execution ID or Job Name**: First, locate the job name or job execution ID for the current date. Use this query as an example:

    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION 
    WHERE JOB_NAME = 'your_job_name' 
      AND START_TIME >= CURDATE();
    ```

2. **Delete from Metadata Tables**: Using the `JOB_EXECUTION_ID` you found, delete entries from the following tables in this order to ensure referential integrity:

    ```sql
    -- Delete job parameters
    DELETE FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_PARAMS
    WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = <your_job_execution_id>;

    -- Delete job execution context
    DELETE FROM BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT
    WHERE STEP_EXECUTION_ID IN (
        SELECT STEP_EXECUTION_ID 
        FROM BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION 
        WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = <your_job_execution_id>
    );

    -- Delete step executions
    DELETE FROM BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
    WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = <your_job_execution_id>;

    -- Delete job execution
    DELETE FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION
    WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = <your_job_execution_id>;

    -- Delete job instance (if no longer needed)
    DELETE FROM BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE 
    WHERE JOB_INSTANCE_ID = (SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID 
                             FROM BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION 
                             WHERE JOB_EXECUTION_ID = <your_job_execution_id>);
    ```

3. **Re-run the Job**: Now that entries for the current date are removed, you can safely re-run your job without interference from previous executions.

**Caution**: Deleting from these tables can impact the history of job executions, so it’s best to only delete entries when you’re sure it’s necessary for a specific job re-run.
