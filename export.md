To insert a Data Encryption Key (DEK) for field-level encryption in MongoDB, you typically use the `insert` command along with the `keyAltNames` field to specify the key's alternate names. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Start the MongoDB Shell**:
   Start the MongoDB shell by running the `mongo` command in your terminal.

2. **Switch to the Desired Database**:
   Switch to the database where you want to store the DEK. For example, if you want to store it in the `mydatabase` database, use the following command:
   ```bash
   use mydatabase
   ```

3. **Insert the DEK**:
   Use the `insert` command to insert the DEK document into the appropriate collection. You need to specify the key material and the alternate names for the key.

   For example, let's say you want to insert a DEK with the key material "mykeymaterial" and the alternate names "key1" and "key2". You can do it as follows:

   ```javascript
   db.createCollection("encryptionKeys")
   db.encryptionKeys.insert({
     "_id" : UUID("my-dek-id"), // Use a unique ID for the DEK
     "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"mykeymaterial"), // Use your actual key material here
     "creationDate" : new Date(),
     "updateDate" : new Date(),
     "status" : "active",
     "keyAltNames" : ["key1", "key2"] // Alternate names for the key
   })
   ```

   Replace `"my-dek-id"`, `"mykeymaterial"`, `"key1"`, and `"key2"` with your actual values.

4. **Verify the Insertion**:
   You can verify that the DEK has been inserted successfully by querying the collection:
   ```javascript
   db.encryptionKeys.find()
   ```

   This command should return the inserted DEK document.

By following these steps, you can insert a Data Encryption Key (DEK) for field-level encryption in MongoDB using the MongoDB shell. Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual key material and key ID.
