Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service designed to provide high availability, scalability, and low latency. When using Cosmos DB, you can choose between the native Cosmos DB SQL API and the MongoDB API. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Below is a comparison of using Cosmos DB with its native SQL API versus using Cosmos DB with the MongoDB API.

### Cosmos DB SQL API

**Pros:**
1. **Native Integration:** Full integration with Cosmos DB features, including multi-model support, global distribution, and multi-region writes.
2. **Rich Query Capabilities:** Supports SQL-like queries, including JOINs and aggregates, which can be more expressive and powerful than MongoDB's query language.
3. **Comprehensive SDKs:** Access to Cosmos DB SDKs across various programming languages (Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, etc.), offering advanced features and better optimization.
4. **Full Feature Set:** Complete access to all Cosmos DB features, such as time-to-live (TTL), stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions.
5. **Optimized Performance:** Native optimizations for Cosmos DB, potentially offering better performance and lower latency.

**Cons:**
1. **Learning Curve:** Requires learning Cosmos DB-specific query language and SDKs if you are already familiar with MongoDB.
2. **Compatibility:** Not compatible with MongoDB drivers and tools, which can be a limitation if you are migrating an existing MongoDB application.

### Cosmos DB with MongoDB API

**Pros:**
1. **Ease of Migration:** Allows existing MongoDB applications to migrate to Cosmos DB with minimal changes to the codebase.
2. **Familiar Ecosystem:** Supports MongoDB drivers and tools, making it easier for developers familiar with MongoDB to use Cosmos DB.
3. **Flexibility:** Offers a way to leverage Cosmos DB's global distribution and scalability features while using the familiar MongoDB query language and ecosystem.
4. **Feature Parity:** Many features of MongoDB are supported, including indexes, aggregations, and BSON document structure.

**Cons:**
1. **Limited Feature Set:** Some advanced Cosmos DB features may not be fully supported or accessible via the MongoDB API.
2. **Performance Overheads:** Potential performance overheads compared to using the native SQL API, as there might be some translation layer between MongoDB API calls and Cosmos DB's underlying storage.
3. **Compatibility Issues:** Not all MongoDB features and versions are fully compatible or supported, which might require adjustments in the application.

### When to Use Which

- **Cosmos DB SQL API:**
  - If you are starting a new project and want to leverage all advanced features of Cosmos DB.
  - When you need rich query capabilities and advanced functionality like stored procedures and user-defined functions.
  - If you require optimized performance for Cosmos DB's native operations.

- **Cosmos DB with MongoDB API:**
  - If you have an existing MongoDB application and want to migrate to Cosmos DB with minimal changes.
  - When you want to continue using MongoDB drivers and tools while benefiting from Cosmos DB's scalability and global distribution.
  - If your development team is already experienced with MongoDB and you want to minimize the learning curve.
