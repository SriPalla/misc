Running a local instance of Cosmos DB using Docker on a Mac with an M2 chip can sometimes be problematic due to architecture differences and compatibility issues. Here are some steps and troubleshooting tips that may help you get it running:

### 1. Verify Docker Installation
Ensure Docker is installed and running correctly on your Mac M2. You can download Docker Desktop for Mac from the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### 2. Use the Correct Image
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Microsoft provides a Docker image for Cosmos DB emulator, but it's tailored for x64 architecture. Macs with M1/M2 chips use ARM architecture, so you might need to use an alternative method or workaround. 

### 3. Pull the Cosmos DB Emulator Image
To get the latest Cosmos DB emulator Docker image, run:
```sh
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

### 4. Running the Emulator with Compatibility Mode
Since the Cosmos DB emulator is designed for x64 architecture, you'll need to run it using Docker's built-in emulation for x64:
```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8081:8081 -p 10250:10250 -p 10251:10251 -p 10252:10252 -p 10253:10253 -p 10254:10254 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT=2 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_ENABLE_DATA_PERSISTENCE=true mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

### 5. Check Logs for Errors
If the container fails to start, check the Docker logs for any errors:
```sh
docker logs <container_id>
```
Replace `<container_id>` with the actual container ID.

### 6. Ensure Rosetta 2 is Installed
Rosetta 2 allows Macs with Apple silicon to use apps built for a Mac with an Intel processor. You may need to install Rosetta 2 to ensure compatibility:
```sh
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

### 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Network Issues**: Ensure there are no network conflicts and that ports are available.
- **Permissions**: Ensure Docker has the necessary permissions to run the container.
- **Resource Limits**: Check if Docker Desktop resource settings (CPU, memory) are sufficient for running the emulator.

### 8. Alternatives
If you continue to face issues, consider using an alternative approach:
- **Remote Emulator**: Use the Cosmos DB emulator in a Windows VM or on a remote machine.
- **Azure Free Tier**: Use the free tier of Azure Cosmos DB for development and testing instead of a local emulator.

### Example Docker Run Command with Rosetta 2
Forcing the emulator to run under x64 emulation with Docker on an M1/M2 Mac:
```sh
docker run --platform linux/amd64 --rm -it -p 8081:8081 -p 10250:10250 -p 10251:10251 -p 10252:10252 -p 10253:10253 -p 10254:10254 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_PARTITION_COUNT=2 -e AZURE_COSMOS_EMULATOR_ENABLE_DATA_PERSISTENCE=true mcr.microsoft.com/cosmosdb/linux/azure-cosmos-emulator
```

This forces Docker to use the `linux/amd64` platform, which can help resolve compatibility issues on ARM-based Macs.
