For a production environment with a 2-second response time SLA, here are the optimized configuration values and strategies for each non-functional requirement:

### 1. **Response Time**
   - **Normal Load**:
     - **Target**: 95% of responses should be under 2 seconds.
     - **Config**: Ensure your application is optimized for quick responses by minimizing processing time and using efficient algorithms.
   - **Peak Load**:
     - **Target**: 95% of responses should remain under 2 seconds during peak traffic.
     - **Config**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., in-memory caches like Redis) and optimize database queries to handle high load efficiently.
   - **Timeouts**:
     - **Downstream Service Timeout**: Set a timeout of 1 second for calls to downstream services.
     - **Internal Processing Timeout**: Set internal processing timeouts to ensure operations complete quickly, avoiding bottlenecks.
   - **Monitoring**:
     - **Tools**: Use tools like Prometheus with Grafana for real-time monitoring of response times and alerts on SLA breaches.

### 2. **Retry Definitions for Downstream Calls**
   - **Max Retries**:
     - **Value**: Configure a maximum of 2 or 3 retry attempts to avoid excessive delays.
   - **Backoff Strategy**:
     - **Value**: Use exponential backoff with a cap (e.g., initial delay of 200ms, doubling each time, up to a maximum of 1 second).
   - **Circuit Breaker**:
     - **Thresholds**: Configure circuit breakers with thresholds for failure rates (e.g., if 50% of requests fail within a 10-second window).
   - **Idempotency**:
     - **Design**: Ensure retryable operations are idempotent to avoid unintended side effects.

### 3. **Availability**
   - **Uptime Target**:
     - **Value**: Aim for 99.9% availability, translating to a maximum of 8.76 hours of downtime per year.
   - **Redundancy**:
     - **Deployment**: Use multiple instances and regions (or availability zones) to ensure redundancy.
   - **Failover**:
     - **Configuration**: Implement active-active or active-passive failover strategies.
   - **Health Checks**:
     - **Frequency**: Perform health checks at 30-second intervals to detect and address issues quickly.
   - **Disaster Recovery**:
     - **RTO/RPO**: Define an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of under 1 hour and an RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of under 5 minutes.

### 4. **Memory and CPU Consumption for POD-Based Deployment**
   - **Resource Requests and Limits**:
     - **Memory**:
       - **Request**: 512MB per pod.
       - **Limit**: 1GB per pod.
     - **CPU**:
       - **Request**: 0.5 CPU per pod.
       - **Limit**: 1 CPU per pod.
   - **Scaling**:
     - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Configure autoscaling to trigger based on CPU utilization (e.g., scale out when CPU usage exceeds 70%).
     - **Vertical Pod Autoscaling**: Adjust resource requests and limits based on historical usage patterns.
   - **Monitoring**:
     - **Tools**: Use Kubernetes metrics server or custom monitoring solutions to track memory and CPU usage.

### 5. **Performance Testing**
   - **Load Testing**:
     - **Tool**: Use JMeter, Gatling, or Locust to simulate realistic load scenarios.
     - **Targets**: Ensure the API can handle the expected peak load with 95% of responses within 2 seconds.
   - **Stress Testing**:
     - **Objective**: Identify the breaking point of the system and understand how it handles extreme load.
     - **Metrics**: Measure response times, error rates, and system stability under stress.
   - **Endurance Testing**:
     - **Objective**: Test the system under continuous load over an extended period (e.g., 24 hours) to identify issues such as memory leaks.
   - **Capacity Planning**:
     - **Approach**: Use test results to plan for future scaling needs, ensuring that infrastructure can handle growth without performance degradation.

### **Optimized Config Values for Production**

- **Response Time**: Ensure 95% of responses are under 2 seconds. Use caching, optimize queries, and minimize processing time.
- **Retries**: Max 2-3 retries with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern.
- **Availability**: Aim for 99.9% uptime, use redundancy and failover strategies, and have robust disaster recovery plans.
- **Resource Allocation**: Set appropriate resource requests and limits for pods, and configure autoscaling based on usage patterns.
- **Performance Testing**: Conduct comprehensive load, stress, and endurance testing to validate and refine configurations.

Implementing these configurations and strategies will help ensure your API meets the 2-second response time SLA and maintains high performance and reliability in production.
